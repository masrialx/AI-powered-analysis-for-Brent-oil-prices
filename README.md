# Brent Oil Price Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

Welcome to the **Brent Oil Price Analysis** project by Birhan Energies! This repository contains the code, analysis, and tools to explore how major eventsâ€”like political decisions, conflicts, sanctions, and OPEC policiesâ€”impact Brent oil prices. Our mission? To deliver actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies tackling the ups and downs of the oil market.

## Project Overview

At Birhan Energies, we turn messy data into smart strategies. This project dives into historical Brent oil prices (1987â€“2022) and uncovers how global events drive price changes. Weâ€™ve got statistical models, exploratory analysis, and plans for a slick interactive dashboard to make sense of it all.

### Whatâ€™s the Goal?
- **Analyze**: Link key events (political, economic, regulatory) to Brent oil price fluctuations.
- **Measure**: Quantify how much these events shake up prices.
- **Guide**: Provide clear insights for investment, policy, and operational decisions.

### Why It Matters
Oil prices are a rollercoaster. Investors need help managing risks, policymakers need data for stability, and energy companies need forecasts to keep operations humming. Weâ€™re here to light the way!

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

### 1. Data
- **Dataset**: Historical Brent oil prices (daily, May 20, 1987 â€“ September 30, 2022)
- **Fields**:
  - `Date`: Day-month-year (e.g., 20-May-87)
  - `Price`: USD per barrel
- **Future Additions**: Economic indicators, tech advancements, political events (from sources like World Bank, IMF, IEA).

### 2. Analysis Workflow
Weâ€™re breaking this into three tasks:

#### Task 1: Define the Workflow
- Planned the steps: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modeling.
- Explored time series models (ARIMA, GARCH) and Bayesian tools (PyMC3).
- Set assumptions and thought about how to share findings with stakeholders.

#### Task 2: Analyze Brent Oil Prices
- Built models to spot trends and event impacts:
  - **Time Series**: ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, Markov-Switching ARIMA
  - **Machine Learning**: LSTM for deeper patterns
- Considered factors like:
  - Economic indicators (GDP, inflation, USD rates)
  - Tech changes (fracking, renewables)
  - Political moves (sanctions, regulations)
- Validated with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

#### Task 3: Build an Interactive Dashboard
- **Backend**: Flask APIs to serve data and results.
- **Frontend**: React interface with interactive charts (planned).
- **Features** (in progress):
  - Show price trends, forecasts, and event correlations.
  - Add filters for dates, events, and metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: For analysis and backend.
- **TensorFlow Environment**: Looks like youâ€™re using a `tf_env`â€”great for ML models!
- **Git**: To clone this repo.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-powered-analysis-for-Brent-oil-prices.git
   cd AI-powered-analysis-for-Brent-oil-prices
   ```

2. **Set Up the Python Environment**:
   If using your `tf_env`:
   ```bash
   source ~/path-to-tf_env/bin/activate  # Activate your TensorFlow env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python brent-oil-analysis.py
   ```
   Check out `brent-oil-analysis2.py` for alternative approaches!

4. **Start the Flask App** (if ready):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## How to Use It

1. **Explore the Notebooks**: Head to `/notebooks` for EDA and early findings.
2. **Run the Analysis**: Use `/src/brent-oil-analysis.py` to dig into the dataâ€”modify it as you see fit!
3. **Check the Backend**: `app.py` is your Flask hubâ€”run it to test API endpoints (if implemented).
4. **Add Your Touch**: Drop new scripts in `/scripts` or tests in `/tests`.

---

## Next Steps
- **Data**: Add external datasets (economic, political) to `src` or `notebooks`.
- **Models**: Expand `brent-oil-analysis.py` with VAR, LSTM, or Bayesian methods.
- **Dashboard**: Build out the React frontendâ€”stay tuned for updates!
